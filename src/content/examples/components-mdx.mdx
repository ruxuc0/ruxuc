import InfoBox from '../../components/InfoBox.astro';

## using custom components

mdx allows you to import and use astro components directly in your content. here are some examples:

<InfoBox type="info" title="information">
this is an info box component. you can use it to highlight important information in your posts.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="be careful">
this is a warning box. use it to alert readers about potential issues or important considerations.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="success" title="great job">
this is a success box. perfect for celebrating achievements or confirming successful operations.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="error" title="something went wrong">
this is an error box. use it to highlight problems or failures that need attention.
</InfoBox>

## components without titles

you can also use components without titles for simpler callouts:

<InfoBox type="info">
just some additional information without a specific title.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning">
a simple warning without a title header.
</InfoBox>

## mixing components with markdown

components can be seamlessly mixed with regular markdown content:

here's a regular paragraph followed by a component:

<InfoBox type="success" title="pro tip">
you can write **markdown** inside components too! this includes:

- bullet points
- 
- [links](https://astro.build)

and even code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("hello from inside a component");
```
</InfoBox>

and here's more regular content after the component.

## component composition

you can create rich content experiences by combining multiple components:

<InfoBox type="info" title="getting started">
first, make sure you have all dependencies installed.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="compatibility note">  
this feature requires astro v5.0 or higher.
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="success" title="you're ready">
everything is set up correctly! you can now start using these components in your posts.
</InfoBox>

## technical implementation

the InfoBox component demonstrates several astro features:

1. **typescript props interface** - defining component props with types
2. **conditional rendering** - showing titles only when provided  
3. **dynamic classes** - applying different styles based on props
4. **slots** - allowing content to be passed into the component
5. **template expressions** - using javascript in the template

this makes mdx a powerful authoring format for technical documentation and rich content experiences.
